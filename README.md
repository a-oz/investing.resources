&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Part 1 - Basic Research/Learning

### [Investopedia's Stocks Basics Tutorial](http://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/)
> Investopedia is a fantastic website to start learning about investing, and this guide is the first that I'd recommend reading. It's broken down into 9 parts, and does a great job explaining the basic fundamentals of stocks, and how they work. Before you can learn how to pick stocks its essential to know what stocks are, and how they work.

### [The Intelligent Investor, By Benjamin Graham](https://smile.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488165326&sr=8-1&keywords=the+intelligent+investor)
> The Intelligent Investor is a fairly long 640 page book by Benjamin Graham that teaches the ways of value investing. He is known as an excellent investment advisor who focuses on long term investment strategies. After reading the Investopedia page above, this book will break down those fundamental concepts that you learned into usable advice on how to how to pick your stocks. When you start picking stocks, this book is great to reference and can be helpful down the line.

### [The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, Fourth Edition](https://smile.amazon.com/Essays-Warren-Buffett-Lessons-Corporate/dp/1611637589/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488245060&sr=8-1&keywords=the+essays+of+warren+buffett)
> This is a great book to get a look inside the world of corporate finance and investing. You'll learn a lot about valuating stocks, and how to practice value investing. His essays cover a wide variety of topics, all very beneficial to someone looking to get into the world of investing.

&nbsp;

## Part 2 - Developing a Strategy

### [Introduction to Fundamental Analysis](https://www.tradeking.com/education/stocks/fundamental-analysis-explained)
> Fundamental analysis is one of the most important methods to learn how to pick stocks. This article on TradeKing's website breaks down how to perform fundamental analysis on a company. They go over how to read balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, all very important when learning how to value a company and decide whether or not you want to invest.
### [Technical Analysis for Beginners](http://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/)
> This isn't entirely necessary to learn before you begin, but it definitely helps to have a basic knowledge of stock market technical analysis. If this is confusing at first, you may want to wait to learn this as it could confuse you further.

### [The Importance of Diversifying](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/111502.asp)
> One of the most important aspects of investing is the practice of diversifying. It's going to be tempting to load up on penny stocks that could double overnight, but this is where a lot of people lose a lot of money. One way to avoid this mistake, is by letting somebody else make money for you. Stocks like BKR.B, or a Vangard Fund that make consistent profits year over year are a great foundation. I would recommend allocating anywhere from 30-50% of your portfolio to these, at least for when you are just beginning. Aside from just being a safety net, these stocks tend to provide consistent growth between ~4-10% annually. This may not sound like much, but netting 10% annually is a difficult thing to do as an investor. This is going to help you because it will give you some steady growth and a solid base so if you ever make a mistake (spoiler alert: you will) it won't have as great of an impact. You can always allocate your money differently in the future when you have a better understanding of what you're doing.


&nbsp;

## Part 3 - Testing your strategy


### [Try a stock market simulator](http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/)
> Now that you have a solid foundation of knowledge and are starting to form a strategy, its good to learn with fake money. This stock market simulator is completely free, and gives you $100,000 of virtual money to use to buy and sell stocks in real time. This is the point where you should set a goal for yourself. If you plan on paper trading for 3 months, a realistic goal could be to net 3% ($3,000) profit on the account. One important thing to note, is that you shouldn't do risky plays that you wouldn't normally do just because its fake money. Try your best to treat it like your own money so you can learn to discipline yourself and learn risk management. If your strategies aren't working, just be patient and see what you did wrong, and use that knowledge when researching your next pick.

> Once you find a viable strategy that consistently works for you (make sure you aren't just getting lucky) and this is the point where you should start on Robinhood and start trading using the same strategies that worked for you during paper trading. If you start on Robinhood and you aren't doing so well, just relax and go back to paper trading, and maybe do some more research on investing, because one thing that you'll find is that there's always something new you can learn in investing.

### Conclusion

> I wish that I took all these steps before I started investing, so I've decided to share them with you guys. I'd love to hear more suggestions, so if people have other resources they use/used to learn leave a comment, and I can add them and give you credit in the post! Buying books can be a little pricey, but honestly the value you get out of The Intelligent Investor is fantastic for $12. The Warren Buffet book is a little more expensive, but as you can see there are plenty of free resources to learn about investing that you can use if you don't want to spend money. Hopefully some people learn from this, and I'd love to hear your feedback! If anyone has any ideas for educational posts I can make in the future, I'd love to hear them!
